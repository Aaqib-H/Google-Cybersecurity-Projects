# SQL Investigation

## Project Description
In this project, I used SQL filters to help an organization investigate potential security issues and ensure the system remains secure. By applying various filters on the `log_in_attempts` and `employees` tables, I was able to identify suspicious login activities, track user behaviors, and assist in updating machines across different departments. This allowed me to support the organization's security efforts by focusing on relevant data.

## Scenario
As a security professional at a large organization, my job was to investigate potential security threats. I noticed suspicious login attempts, especially outside business hours, and some employees' devices needed to be updated. My task was to filter and analyze data from the `log_in_attempts` and `employees` tables to investigate security incidents and assist in machine updates.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Queries to filter and analyze data.
- **`WHERE`** **Clause**: Applied conditions to narrow down the results.
- **`AND`**, **`OR`**, **`NOT`**, **`LIKE`**, **`%`** **Operators**: Used to filter based on multiple conditions.

## Skills Learned
- Writing SQL queries to filter data based on time, location, and department.
- Using SQL operators to combine multiple filtering conditions.
- Applying pattern matching with `LIKE` and `%` wildcards to retrieve specific records.
- Analyzing login attempt data to identify potential security risks.

## Project Steps:
1. **Retrieve After-Hours Failed Login Attempts**:
   - Investigated failed login attempts occurring after 6:00 PM to identify unauthorized access attempts outside business hours.

2. **Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates**:
   - Focused on suspicious login activity on May 8-9, 2022, to pinpoint potential security issues on those dates.

3. **Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico**:
   - Analyzed login attempts from countries other than Mexico, which was cleared of suspicious activity.

4. **Retrieve Employees in Marketing Department**:
   - Queried for employees in the Marketing department located in the East building for necessary machine updates.

5. **Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales Departments**:
   - Filtered employees from the Finance and Sales departments to ensure their devices were updated.

6. **Retrieve All Employees Not in IT Department**:
   - Identified employees not in the IT department to exclude them from a specific update process.

## Project Outcome
Through the application of SQL filters, I successfully retrieved and analyzed specific login attempt data and employee information. This allowed the organization to focus on potential security risks, investigate suspicious activities, and manage machine updates across various departments. By filtering data efficiently, I contributed to enhancing the organizationâ€™s overall security posture and operational efficiency.
