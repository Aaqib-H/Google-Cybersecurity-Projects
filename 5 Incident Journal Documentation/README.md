# Incident Journal Documentation

## Description
I used the incident handler's journal to document security incidents throughout the course, track my learning, and record the tools and techniques I used. It helped me reflect on what I learned and created a useful reference for future incidents. By adding it to my portfolio, I can showcase my experience to potential employers.

## Key Skills Learned:
- Documentation: I improved my ability to document incidents clearly and accurately.
- Incident Response: I practiced the steps of detection, analysis, containment, and recovery.
- Analytical Thinking: I strengthened my ability to analyze and solve security issues.
- Communication: I enhanced my skills in conveying technical details effectively.
- Tool Familiarity: I gained hands-on experience with various cybersecurity tools.
