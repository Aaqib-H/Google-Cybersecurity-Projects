## Projects

### 1. Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap
- **Objective**: Use Nmap for network scanning, port discovery, and vulnerability assessment to identify potential security issues.
- **Skills Learned**: Network scanning, host discovery, service enumeration, port scanning, and vulnerability detection.
- **Key Tools**: Nmap
- **Steps**:
  - Verified Nmap installation and version.
  - Referenced `man` pages and help features for guidance.
  - Scanned for active hosts, open ports, services, and operating system details.
  - Customized scans and saved results for later analysis.
- **Outcome**: Successfully identified open ports and vulnerabilities within the target environment.

### 2. Metasploit Penetration Testing
- **Objective**: Perform a penetration test using Metasploit and Nmap in a virtualized environment to identify, exploit, and report system vulnerabilities.
- **Skills Learned**: Reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and reporting.
- **Key Tools**: Metasploit, Nmap, Kali Linux, VMware Workstation
- **Steps**:
  - Set up a controlled environment with Metasploitable 2 as the target machine and Kali Linux as the attack machine.
  - Performed reconnaissance with Nmap to identify open ports and services.
  - Researched CVEs and confirmed exploitable vulnerabilities.
  - Executed exploits using Metasploit to gain system access and configured persistence.
  - Documented findings and created a penetration testing report.
- **Outcome**: Demonstrated exploitation capabilities and identified areas for security improvement.
