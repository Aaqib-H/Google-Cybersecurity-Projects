- **Key Tools**: Controls and Compliance Checklist, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Risk Assessment Report.
- **Steps**:
  - Reviewed Botium Toys' IT assets, scope, and risk assessment report.
  - Assessed security controls across administrative, technical, and physical categories.
  - Evaluated compliance with standards like PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC.
  - Identified key risks, including insufficient encryption, lack of access control, and absence of disaster recovery plans.
  - Documented findings and provided actionable recommendations for improving security.
- **Outcome**: Identified critical areas for improvement, including access control, encryption, and incident preparedness, with recommendations to enhance security and compliance.


### 2. [Incident Response with NIST CSF](https://github.com/Aaqib-H/Google-Cybersecurity-Projects/tree/main/2%20Incident%20Response%20with%20NIST%20CSF)

- **Objective**: Analyze and document the response to a simulated DDoS attack on a multimedia company, applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to enhance incident response and improve network security resilience.
- **Skills Learned**: Incident analysis, network security assessment, application of NIST CSF, report documentation
- **Key Tools**: Incident Response Plan, NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **Steps**:
  - Assessed the impact of the DDoS attack, which involved a flood of ICMP packets that disrupted internal network traffic.
  - Applied the NIST CSF functions: Identified vulnerabilities in firewall configurations, implemented protective controls, and monitored for abnormal traffic patterns.
  - Documented detection strategies, including the use of an IDS/IPS and network monitoring to identify suspicious traffic.
- **Outcome**: Demonstrated exploitation capabilities and identified areas for security improvement.


### 3. [Managing File Permissions with Linux](https://github.com/Aaqib-H/Google-Cybersecurity-Projects/tree/main/3%20Managing%20File%20Permissions%20in%20Linux)

- **Objective**: Configure file and directory permissions in a Linux environment ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users, thereby enhancing data security and compliance.
- **Skills Learned**: Linux file system management, permission configuration, security best practices, command-line tools
- **Key Tools**: Linux Command Line
- **Steps**:
  - Auditing current file and directory Permissions.
  - Understanding the permissions string.
  - Updating hidden file and directory permissions.
- **Outcome**: Updated file and directory permissions to meet authorization standards, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data within the research team's directory.


### 4. [SQL Investigation](https://github.com/Aaqib-H/Google-Cybersecurity-Projects/tree/main/4%20SQL%20Investigation)

- **Objective**: Use SQL filters to identify and analyze suspicious login activities, track user behaviors, and assist with updating machines across different departments.
- **Skills Learned**: Writing SQL queries, applying operators, filtering based on time, location and department data.
- **Key Tools**: SQL queries
- **Steps**:
  - Retrieve failed login attempts occurring after business hours to identify unauthorized access.
  - Focus on suspicious login attempts on specific dates (e.g., May 8-9, 2022).
  - Retrieve employee data for analysis.
  - Update employee data to enhance security posture.
- **Outcome**: Successfully identified suspicious login attempts and tracked employee department data to manage machine updates, enhancing the organization's security posture and operational efficiency.
  

### 5. [Incident Journal Documentation](https://github.com/Aaqib-H/Google-Cybersecurity-Projects/tree/main/5%20Incident%20Journal%20Documentation)

- **Objective**: Document and track security incidents throughout the course, applying incident response techniques and tools while reflecting on the process to build a professional portfolio.
- **Skills Learned**: Incident documentation, incident response steps, analytical thinking, communication, tool usage.
- **Key Tools**: Incident handler’s journal, reflection and documentation techniques.
- **Steps**:
  - Document security incidents and steps taken to resolve them.
  - Reflect on incident response methods and tools used.
  - Track progress and identify areas for improvement in response actions.
  - Build a professional portfolio with documented incidents.
- **Outcome**: Developed a detailed incident handler’s journal, which serves as a reference for future cybersecurity incidents and a valuable addition to my portfolio, showcasing my experience and skills in incident response.


### 6. [Python File Parsing Automation](https://github.com/Aaqib-H/Google-Cybersecurity-Projects/tree/main/6%20Python%20File%20Parsing%20Automation)

- **Objective**: Automate the process of updating an IP address allow list by checking for IPs to be removed from access to restricted content, ensuring security and compliance.
- **Skills Learned**: File handling in Python, data manipulation using strings and lists, automating tasks, using loops and conditionals to process data, ensuring data integrity.
- **Key Tools**: Python, file I/O methods
- **Steps**:
  - Open the `allow_list.txt` file and read its contents.
  - Convert the file content (string format) into a list of IP addresses.
  - Iterate through the remove list and remove any matching IP addresses from the allow list.
  - Convert the updated list of IP addresses back into a string and write it to the `allow_list.txt` file.
- **Outcome**: Developed a Python algorithm that successfully automates the updating of an IP address allow list by removing unauthorized IPs. The solution improves efficiency and reduces human error in managing access to restricted content, contributing to the organization’s overall security measures.
